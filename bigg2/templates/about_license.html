<div class="modal-body">
  <p>BiGG 2 is currently a beta release, which means that we are still testing
    the database and website. Please be patient if you encounter bugs, and be
    aware that some changes to the database content may change before the final
    release. If you have questions or find any bugs in the database, please
    contact Zachary King (zaking-AT-ucsd-DOT-edu).</p>

  <h4 class="modal-title">About BiGG</h4>
</div>
<div class="modal-body">

	<p>BiGG is a knowledgebase of Biochemically, Genetically and Genomically
	  structured genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions.</p>

	<p>BiGG integrates more than 70 published genome-scale metabolic
	  networks into a single database with a set of stardized identifiers
	  called BiGG IDs. Gene in the BiGG models are mapped to NCBI genome
	  annotations, and metabolites are linked to many external databases
	  (KEGG, PubChem, and many more).</p>

	<p>BiGG is freely available for non-commercial use. It is hosted and
	  maintained by the <a href="http://systemsbiology.ucsd.edu/">Systems Biology
	  Research Group</a> at the <a href="http://ucsd.edu"> University of California, San Diego</a>.</p>

  <h4 class="modal-title">How do I use BiGG?</h4>
</div>
<div class="modal-body">
  <p>BiGG can be browsed on this website or accessed using a <a href="/web_api">web
    API</a>. Try searching for a metabolite, reaction, gene, or organism in the
    search box to browse the content of genome-scale models. Question marks like
    this {% include 'question_mark.html' %} are available throughout the site to
    provide more help.
